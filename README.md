# rexams-tutorial

**Summary**: (enough to start)

This Github page is intended to be a simple tutorial for using the "exams" R package to generate files, typically testbanks.

These Rmd (Rmarkdown) files are to be used with the "exams" R package:\
https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1337

While it is certainly possible to install this package on CRAN as would typically be done,
 I recommend using the latest version from the R-forge page above because it always contains the latest (pre-CRAN upload) changes.
 These changes can be particularly important for Canvas.

The files are intended to be used (learned) in sequence.  This helps with understanding how these markdown files are generated--from simple to complex.

**Rmd files**:

1. ***01-mult-num-static***
    * genre: multiplicaton, type: numeric, versioning: static

I welcome your feedback.
